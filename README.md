# OpenGL Project 
This project demonstrates a 3D scene created using OpenGL and GLAD, featuring an interactive building and a bicycle. The scene includes various interactive features such as opening and closing doors and windows, moving the bicycle, and controlling the camera view.

## Features
1. 3D Building:
    - Two floors, a roof, one door, and four windows.
    - Suitable colors applied to different parts of the building.
    - Interactive door and windows controlled by keyboard input.
2. 3D Bicycle:
    - Black colored bicycle with frame, wheels, and handlebars.
    - Interactive movement and wheel rotation controlled by keyboard input.
3. Scene Customization:
    - Green background color.
    - Camera control to view the scene from different angles.
4. Animation:
    - Bicycle moves in a circular path around the building.
    - Animation enabled/disabled using mouse buttons.

## Controls
  1. Building Interactions
      - Press o to open the door.
      - Press c to close the door.
      - Press O to open the windows.  
      - Press C to close the windows.
  2. Bicycle Interactions
      - Press f to move the bicycle forward.
      - Press b to move the bicycle backward.
      - Press r to rotate the right wheel.
      - Press l to rotate the left wheel.
  3. Animation Control
      - Left mouse button to enable bicycle animation.
      - Right mouse button to disable bicycle animation.
      - Camera Control
      - Arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the camera.

## Setup and Compilation
1. Prerequisites:
    - C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
    - OpenGL
    - GLFW
    - GLAD
2. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanReda17/OpenGL-Project/
    cd OpenGL-Project
  ```
3. Build the project:
    - Ensure you have a Glad and Opengl configured for your project. Then, run it.
